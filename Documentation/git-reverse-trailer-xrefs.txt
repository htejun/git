NAME

git-reverse-trailer-xrefs - Record reverse-map of trailer commit references into notes

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
`git reverse_trailer_xrefs` --xref-cherry-picks [--clear] [<options>] [<commit-ish>...]
`git reverse_trailer_xrefs` --trailer-prefix=<prefix> --ref=<notes-ref> --tag=<tag> [<options>] [<commit-ish>...]
`git reverse_trailer_xrefs` --ref=<notes-ref> --clear [<options>] [<commit-ish>...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Record or clear reverse-map of trailer commit references in the
specified notes ref.

Some commit trailers reference other commits. For example,
`git-cherry-pick -x` adds the following trailer to record the source
commit.
----------
`(cherry picked from commit <source-commit-id>)`
----------
The reverse mapping of such cross references can be useful. For
cherry-picks, it would allow finding all the cherry-picked commits of
a given source commit.  `git-reverse-trailer-xrefs` can be used to
create and maintain such reverse mappings using notes.

When used with `--xref-cherry-picks`, the cherry-pick trailers are
parsed from the specified commits and the reverse mappings are created
in the following form.
----------
`Cherry-picked-to: <destination-commit-id>`
----------
The reverse mapping is attached to the source commit in its
`refs/notes/xrefs-cherry-picks` note.

When showing notes in `refs/notes/xrefs-`
