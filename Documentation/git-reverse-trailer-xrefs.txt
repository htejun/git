NAME
----
git-reverse-trailer-xrefs - Record reverse-map of trailer commit references into notes

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
`git reverse_trailer_xrefs` --xref-cherry-picks [--clear] [<options>] [<commit-ish>...]
`git reverse_trailer_xrefs` --trailer-prefix=<prefix> --ref=<notes-ref> [--tag=<tag>] [<options>] [<commit-ish>...]
`git reverse_trailer_xrefs` --ref=<notes-ref> --clear [<options>] [<commit-ish>...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Record or clear reverse-map of trailer commit references in the
specified notes ref.

Some commit trailers reference other commits. For example,
`git-cherry-pick -x` adds the following trailer to record the source
commit.
----------
`(cherry picked from commit <source-commit-id>)`
----------
The reverse mappings of such cross references can be useful. For
cherry-picks, it would allow finding all the cherry-picked commits of
a given source commit.  `git-reverse-trailer-xrefs` can be used to
create and maintain such reverse mappings in notes.

When used with `--xref-cherry-picks`, the cherry-pick trailers are
parsed from the specified commits and the reverse mappings are
recorded in the `refs/notes/xref-cherry-picks` notes of the source
commits in the following format.
----------
`Cherry-picked-to: <destination-commit-id>`
----------

When a note with its notes ref starting with `refs/notes/xref-` is
formatted to be displayed with the commit for, e.g., `git-show` or
`git-log`, the destination commit is followed recursively and the
matching notes are shown with increasing level of indentations.

`--trailer-prefix`, `--notes` and `--tag` can be used to use a custom
set of trailer, notes ref and reverse mapping tag.

OPTIONS
-------
<commit-ish>...::
	Commit-ish object names to describe.  Defaults to HEAD if omitted.

--xref-cherry-picks::
	Use the preset to reverse map `git-cherry-pick -x`
	trailers. `--trailer-prefix` is set to "(cherry-picked from
	commit ", `--notes` is set to "refs/notes/xref-cherry-picks"
	and `--tag` is set to "Cherry-picked-to". This option can't be
	specified with the three preset options.

--trailer-prefix=<prefix>::
	Process trailers which start with <prefix>. It is matched
	character-by-character and should be followed by the
	referenced commit ID. When there are multiple matching
	trailers, the last one is used.

--notes=<notes-ref>::
	The notes ref to use for the reverse mapping. While this can
	be any notes ref, it is recommented to use ones starting with
	"refs/notes/xref-" as they are recognized as cross-referencing
	notes and handled specially when updating and showing.

--tag=<tag>::
	Optional tag to use when generating reverse reference
	notes. If specified, each note line is formatted as "<tag>:
	<commit-id>"; otherwise, "<commit-id>".

--clear::
	Instead of creating reverse mapping notes, clear them from the
	specified commits.
